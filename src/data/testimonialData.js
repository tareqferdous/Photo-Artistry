    review:
      "Wedding photography covered my wedding and reception. Both the events were covered by Jubayer Hossain Shuvo Bhaiya. I couldn’t have been happier, even my wedding video turned out to be amazing. On top that, I didn’t quite like the song that I gave for my reception promo and they said they would change it for me even without me asking for it. Very satisfied with the service. I would like to thank them for making my special day a tad bit more special. Thanks to the team for taking all the pains and the way they took care of it was beyond my expectations. The Team was so supportive and fun-loving besides taking photographs. Thank You Wedding Diary for making our event special.",

      "I highly recommend wedding photography. They covered all our wedding events. The photos came out great and on time as promised. Everyone is super nice and friendly. They worked according to our preference. I would especially like to give a shout out to Aman Rahman. He was there on all 3 events. Very friendly and created a really nice environment with us and my friends and family. Took care of all our needs. My family and friends loved you! Cinematography was perfect as well. It brought happy tears when we first saw our trailers. Overall, they have amazing staffs and both Nafis and Shuvo bhaiya took some magical pictures of us. I, very much appreciated their service and would highly recommend for anyone’s big day!",

      "You people have done a really professional job! My niece recommended ‘wedding photography’ a week before my reception at Savar Golf Club. I didn’t know about you or I had no good references to consider, so I proceed with her decision. Now I should say, she made a perfect decision. These are some damn high quality photos I’ve got in my hand. I forgot the main photographer’s name but they call him NFS, he knows his job! He was asking me for different pose while shooting photos, I didn’t know the result would be extraordinary. I do not know much about photography, but in person, I saw the combination of high skill and creativity out there. God bless wedding photography team. I will definitely recommend you guys to my friends, family and business community.",

    review:
      "If there was only one thing that we both had no hesitation deciding for our wedding, then that would be selecting wedding photography. & as expected they have done a tremendous job. We’ve always loved Rafi bhai’s work & he has taken some superb portraits of us & family members -friends. Special thanks to him from both of us. Cinematography was also on point. If there was only one thing that I personally expected to be better then that was Top & Associate photographer’s shots. They’ve certainly covered all the precious moments but in my opinion their photos could’ve been better such as better perspective, better framing, a bit shallower depth of field in small group photos, tighter cropping in some photos etc. ",
